            Here I made a bunch of rockets learning to fly around a planet with a very simpified physics.
        </p>

        <p>
            A rocket's behavior is defined by a small neural network:
        </p>

        <p>
            The first layer takes rocket's height, absolute angle, and velocity's components as input. Then we have two
            hidden layers with 4 nodes each and the output layer, deciding whether the rocket will turn the engine on or
            off, and how much it should turn.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initial weights are random and then evolve to maximize the time the rocket spends in the air.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the top right of the screen you can see the network of the current best rocket.
        </p>

        <p>
            Surprisingly, rockets learnt to orbit the planet quite fast initially, so I added constant air friction, to
            slow them down, but also they have a slow fuel regen to make things a bit more challenging.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever the rocket is orange, it means its engine is on and it has some fuel left.
