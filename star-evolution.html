            This is an infinite puzzle game about the star life cycle. You put one of three randomly given to you stars: red dwarf, yellow dwarf, or blue giant, on the grid, and then they evolve:
        </p>
        <p>
            Red dwarf -> white dwarf -> black dwarf
        </p>
        <p>
            Yellow drawf -> red giant -> white dwarf -> black dwarf
        </p>
        <p>
            Blue giant -> red giant -> red supergiant -> supernova(destroyes red and yellow dwarfs around) -> black hole(consumes neighboring black holes)
        </p>
        <p>
            The game ends when you can't put another star -- the gmae board gets eventually filled with black dwarfs and holes which can't be removed.
        </p>
