        <h1>IdlEuler -- Math Idle Game</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">

        <p>
            If you are not into idle games, this project may seem quite weird to you. The main and only objective is to make a particular number as high as possible. All you can do for that is to buy upgrades which will make it grow faster. But the settings and specific mechanis can make the gamepplay quite interesting and deep. Again, if you are into idle games. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Play the game:
        </p>

        <div class="centered">
            <a href="https://idleuler.onrender.com/">
                <div class="project-card">
                    <img src="images/idleuler-project-bg.jpg">
                    <h3>IdlEuler</h3>
                </div>
            </a>
        </div>

        <p>
            Here is an overview of main mechanics:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>In the "Numbers" section you can upgrade the values of variables.</li>
            <li>In the "Functions" sections you can buy functions using those variables and producing the currency of the game -- Natural numbers.</li>
            <li>In the "Geometry" section you can buy shapes, which also depend on the variables and their properties serve as production multipliers.</li>
            <li>The ascention mechanic of the game (common term for idle games, meaning restarting the game with some powerful boosts) is "Writing a book", when you compose all the knowledge you got in a book, reset your progress, but get some axioms for that.</li>
            <li>All the books you've written can be found in the "Library".</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The next feature I'm working on is "Theorems" -- powerful upgrades you buy for axioms which boost your functions and shapes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game is currently not release-ready, so you can cheat by pressing the "Multiply â„• by 10" button to faster unlock all the content.
